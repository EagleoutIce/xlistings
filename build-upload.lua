-- Shared by build.lua and code-link/build.lua, part of neither release.

-- l3build's own '--dry-run' is not offline: it only skips the second POST, the
-- archive is still sent to CTAN's validate endpoint (and '--debug' posts it to
-- httpbin.org). The 'curl_debug' switch that would suppress this is a local
-- captured before build.lua is read, so it cannot be set from here. Instead we
-- wrap 'upload': under '--dry-run' we build the very same curl request, which
-- runs all of l3build's field validation and writes the .curlopt file, and
-- print it rather than send it. A plain 'l3build upload' is left untouched.
-- Note that redefining the global 'upload' is not enough: 'l3build-stdmain'
-- captures the function into 'target_list' before build.lua is read, so the
-- entry in that table has to be replaced as well.
